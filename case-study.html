            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>
              NotFlix is a web application that will provide users with access
              to information about different movies, directors, genres, actors.
              Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information,
              and create a list of their favorite movies and a watch list of
              movies they intend to watch.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name of the app is a pun on the name Netflix, the famous
              streaming service. I picked it because the content of the app
              reminded me of Netflix without giving the option to stream video
              content. Since it is not Netflix I combined the words “not” and
              “Netflix” into NotFlix.
            </p>
            <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>
              Movie lovers want to learn as much as possible about films and TV
              shows. For example, they may want to learn about a movie’s
              director, genre, cast and rating. NotFlix delivers all these info
              to anyone who’s interested, right at their fingertips. The purpose
              of the app is to facilitate access to movie information thanks to
              a single-page fast application that lets users create watchlists
              and favorite movie lists so they can easily find the movies they
              are interested into and read about them.

            <h2>MY ROLE</h2>

            <p>
              In this project I’ve been the designer and the developer, to
              showcase my abilities of Full Stack Web Developer. I adopted the
              MERN paradigm (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
            </p>

            <p>
              I started from the server-side application, with designing a REST
              API. I decided in which form the data would be stored and
              delivered to the client application. I picked MongoDB to
              experiment with non-relational databases and utilized Node and
              Express to interact with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I moved on to the client-side application, where I had the
              chance to practice with React. Before starting to implement the
              functionalities, I created the UX design using Abobe XD to make a
              prototype. I wanted the app to be intuitive and clear but still
              colorful and fun since the main concept is “entertainment”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I had the UX interface down, I moved onto the implementation
              of the components and I made them interact with the backend using
              Axios methods.

            <h2>Server Application: NotFlix API</h2>

            <p>
              The server application NotFlix API follows a REST architecture,
              which has been implemented by using Node and Express to realize
              the web service, while the data has been stored on a NoSQL
              database, MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information has been modeled into JavaScript objects and then
              turned into NoSQL documents using the JSON format. It was
              interesting to learn about non-relational databases and how
              efficient they can be with their innovative structure. Considering
              the small size of this application, the use of sub-documents
              turned out more efficient than having separate tables for each
              entity only.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to use a modular approach to structure this application.
              I separated the services from the controllers, and I stored the
              model files and routes in a separate folder to keep the code
              organized.
            </p>
            <p>
              The services are used to run the queries on the database, the
              models define how the data is structured and make sure that the
              types are consistent with the ones that come from the storage. I
              implemented JWT(JSON Web Tokens) authentication to allow access to
              the data, so every request that gets sent to the server contains a
              bearer token in the header that needs to get verified; the
              response will be sent only in case of successful authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
              The routes define the actual endpoints so, through the Express
              methods, I was able to define the URLs performing the various
              operations on the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each URL sent as HTTP request invokes a specified HTTP method to
              execute CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the
              data. The HTTP response sent back by the web server contains
              either the resource itself or a message about the operations that
              were applied to the resource.
            </p>
            <p>
              To complete the server application, I documented it using JSDoc,
              but I also provided
              <a href="https://notflixapi.herokuapp.com/docs/" target="_blank"
                >a live page</a
              >
              where all the endpoints are explained with examples.
            </p>
            <p>The application has been deployed on Heroku.</p>

            <h2>Client Application: NotFlix DB</h2>
            <p>
              The client-side application, NotFlix DB, is the web application
              the users interact with. I used React and Redux to implement a
              fast and responsive single-page web application that talks to the
              backend through Axios, sending HTTP requests to the API endpoints
              I created earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              To implement the UX for the frontend, which I previously designed
              myself in Adobe XD, I used React Bootstrap to give a skeleton to
              my interface and then I customized it with CSS animations, flexbox
              and colorful gradients.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the requests made through Axios need to be authenticated, so
              that the API can allow the client to receive the resources it is
              requiring. To do that, I added a bearer token to the header of
              each Axios request, where the token is returned by the server
              after authenticating the user during the login phase, and then
              stored locally.
            </p>

            <p>
              I deployed

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, to start this React project, I used the npm module
              Parcel to compile the code and create the build of the app to run,
              but I was incurring into CORS errors when trying to retrieve the
              images from the database. The link to the images that were served
              were not easily accessible and that was a problem I needed to
              resolve, since the movie poster is one of the main data I needed
              to show in a movie’s detailed view.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made sure that the server-side application was allowing URLs
              coming from any source, but unfortunately that wasn’t fixing my
              issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did some research and I found that the Parcel version I was
              using was older and creating conflicts with some dependencies, so
              the CORS errors weren’t handled properly. While researching I also
              learned about ways to structure the code with a better
              architecture that follows the React best practices. In the end I
              decided to start over and instead initialize my React application
              by using the create-react-app module rather than Parcel.
            </p>
            <p>
              This also fixed the problem with the images’ URLs, resolving the
              CORS errors.
            </p>
            <p>
              In phase of development, the part I found most challenging has
              been adding Redux to manage the state of the app, after the app
              was already in development, so I had to face the problem of using
              a different approach and integrating a new module and its concepts
              into a started project. Even if the learning curve was steep at
              the beginning, I understood actions and reducers and I used them
              to make the state available to any component in the app.
            </p>
            <h3>What went well and what didn’t</h3>
            <p>
              Designing the UI and the UX of the application first helped me to
              understand how to structure the components I was going to create.
              In that way I was able to modularize the functionalities of each
              part of the app and keep them separate which made the components
              reusable and the app highly scalabe.
            </p>
            <h3>What I'd do differently</h3>
            <p>
              To implement my future React applications I’ll probably start with
              create-react-app. The setup was fast and its dependencies were
              compatible with everything else I was using. Also it uses Webpack
              to create the build of the app and it requires zero configuration,
              while Parcel needed to be configured manually and it was creating
              issues with the rest of the modules, besides provoking the CORS
              errors.
