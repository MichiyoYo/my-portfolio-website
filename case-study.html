            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>
              NotFlix is a web application that will provide users with access
              to information about different movies, directors, genres, actors.
              Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information,
              and create a list of their favorite movies and a watch list of
              movies they intend to watch.

            <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
            <p>
              The aim of the project was to have ambitious full stack projects I
              can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to
              resolve is to build a complete server-side and client-side web
              application. NotFlix is, in fact, a full-stack web application:
              the client side uses React while the server side uses Node.

            <h2>PURPOSE & CONTEXT</h2>
            <p>
              NotFlix is a personal project I built as part of my web
              development course at CareerFoundry to practice and demonstrate my
              mastery of full-stack JavaScript developer.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2>Server Application: NotFlix API</h2>
            <p>
              An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of
              communication protocols that allow a software application to plug
              into another one and exchange information.
            </p>
            <p>
              REST (Representational State Transfer) is a common architectural
              pattern that allows the client application to require resources
              from the server by referring to them through endpoints or URLs. By
              receiving the request through HTTP, the API/web service can locate
              the resource on the server if present, and send back the resource
              itself or a message that specifies what data manipulation has been
              applied.
            </p>
            <p>
              The server application NotFlix API follows the above architecture,
              and it has been implemented by using Node and Express to realize
              the web service, while the data has been stored on a NoSQL
              database, MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information has been modeled into JavaScript objects and then
              turned into NoSQL documents using the JSON format. It was
              interesting to learn about non-relational databases and how
              efficient they can be with their innovative structure. Considering
              the small size of this application, the use of sub-documents
              turned out more efficient than having separate tables for each
              entity only.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to use a modular approach to structure this application.
              I separated the services from the controllers, and I stored the
              model files and routes in a separate folder to keep the code
              organized.
            </p>
            <p>
              The services are used to run the queries on the database, the
              models define how the data is structured and make sure that the
              types are consistent with the ones that come from the storage. I
              implemented JWT(JSON Web Tokens) authentication to allow access to
              the data, so every request that gets sent to the server contains a
              bearer token in the header that needs to get verified; the
              response will be sent only in case of successful authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
              The routes define the actual endpoints so, through the Express
              methods, I was able to define the URLs performing the various
              operations on the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each URL sent as HTTP request invokes a specified HTTP method to
              execute CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the
              data. The HTTP response sent back by the web server contains
              either the resource itself or a message about the operations that
              were applied to the resource.
            </p>
            <p>
              To complete the server application, I documented it using JSDoc,
              but I also provided
              <a href="https://notflixapi.herokuapp.com/docs/" target="_blank"
                >a live page</a
              >
              where all the endpoints are explained with examples.
            </p>
            <p>The application has been deployed on Heroku.</p>

            <h2>Client Application: NotFlix DB</h2>
            <p>
              The client-side application, NotFlix DB, is the web application
              the users interact with. I used React and Redux to implement a
              fast and responsive single-page web application that talks to the
              backend through Axios, sending HTTP requests to the API endpoints
              I created earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had fun implementing the UX for the frontend: I used React
              Bootstrap to give a skeleton to my interface and then I customized
              it with CSS animations, flexbox and colorful gradients.
            </p>

            <p>
              After understanding the main concepts of React, such as state,
              props and hooks, I felt immediately confident to create all the
              components I needed, choosing to implement them modularly. I made
              sure that each component takes care of the minimum number of
              functionalities.
            </p>

            <p>
              All the requests made through Axios need to be authenticated, so
              that the API can allow the client to receive the resources it is
              requiring. To do that, I added a bearer token to the header of
              each Axios request, where the token is returned by the server
              after authenticating the user during the login phase, and then
              stored locally.
            </p>
            <p>
              I deployed

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              NotFlix has been the largest and most challenging project I worked
              on during the CareerFoundry program. While working on it, I
              learned the skills I was interested into, such as designing and
              implementing a RESTful API, storing data in a non-relational
              database, authenticating users, and building a fast and responsive
              client application with one of the most popular libraries
              available - React.
            </p>
            <p>
              The part I found most challenging has been integrating Redux to
              manage the state of the app, understanding actions and reducers
              and using them to make the state available to the components by
              mapping it to the props.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also spent some time debugging the app when I stumbled upon a
              CORS error, which was actually due to a syntax error in the
              request the client was sending to the server. After thoroughly
              reading the Axios documentation I learned that, for a POST
              request, I had to include the body of the request before the
              headers’ object, even if the body is empty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, this was my favorite and most complex application, and I
              am proud of it!
